# woRdcomplex-2.1-shiny
Shiny app for [woRdcomplex version 2.1](https://github.com/unccard/woRdcomplex-2.1)

Run the Shiny by downloading the repository and running it locally, or via [shiny io](https://unccard.shinyapps.io/shiny-woRdcomplex-2/)

Also of interest is this [Shiny app]() to compare the complexity of target words compared to actual productions. 

Word Complexity Measure (WCM) is calculated as described in Stoel-Gammon (2010), based on lookup from a database including standard syllabified transcriptions for American English (cmudict.0.6d.syl; Bartlett et al., 2009) and word frequency measures from the SUBTLEX-US dictionary (Brysbaert & New, 2009). Word frequencies are displayed in Zipf units (van Heuven et al 2014), a logarithmic scale defined as log10(word frequency in words per billion), with distribution from approximately 1 (very low frequency) to 7 (high frequency function words, articles, etc.).
